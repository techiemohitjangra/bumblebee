1
00:00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:00:24,699
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath Scared to rock the boat and make a mess

2
00:00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:00:30,000
So I sat quietly, agreed politely

3
00:00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:00:35,399
I guess that I forgot I had a choice I let you push me past the breaking point

4
00:00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:00:40,299
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

5
00:00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:00:52,000
You held me down, but I got up Already brushing off the dust

6
00:00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:00:57,799
You hear my voice, you hear that sound Like thunder, gonna shake your ground

7
00:00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:01:03,000
You held me down, but I got up Get ready cause I've had enough

8
00:00:01:03,000 --> 00:00:01:06,000
I see it all, I see it now

9
00:00:01:06,000 --> 00:00:01:10,500
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter,

10
00:00:01:10,500 --> 00:00:01:16,000
dancing through the fire 'Cause I am a champion

11
00:00:01:16,000 --> 00:00:01:24,000
and you're gonna hear me roar Louder, louder than a lion

12
00:00:01:24,000 --> 00:00:01:27,000
Cause I am a champion

13
00:00:01:27,000 --> 00:00:01:42,000
and you're gonna hear me roar Oh oh oh oh oh oh You're gonna hear me roar

14
00:00:01:43,299 --> 00:00:01:48,700
Now I'm floating like a butterfly Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes

15
00:00:01:48,700 --> 00:00:01:53,799
I went from zero, to my own hero

16
00:00:01:53,799 --> 00:00:01:59,000
You held me down, but I got up Already brushing off the dust

17
00:00:01:59,000 --> 00:00:02:04,000
You hear my voice, your hear that sound Like thunder, gonna shake your ground

18
00:00:02:04,000 --> 00:00:02:09,500
You held me down, but I got up Get ready 'cause I've had enough

19
00:00:02:09,500 --> 00:00:02:12,500
I see it all, I see it now

20
00:00:02:12,500 --> 00:00:02:17,000
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter,

21
00:00:02:17,000 --> 00:00:02:22,500
dancing through the fire 'cause I am a champion

22
00:00:02:22,500 --> 00:00:02:30,500
and you're gonna hear me roar Louder, louder than a lion

23
00:00:02:30,500 --> 00:00:02:33,500
'cause I am a champion

24
00:00:02:33,500 --> 00:00:02:55,000
and you're gonna hear me roar Oh oh oh oh oh oh You're gonna hear me roar Oh oh oh oh oh oh
