1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,900
Feeling my way through the darkness

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,600
Guided by a beating heart

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,000
I can't tell where the journey will end

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,500
But I know where it starts

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,400
They tell me I'm too young to understand

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
They say I'm caught up in a dream

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,500
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,800
Well that's fine by me

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,700
So wake me up when it's all over

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,800
When I'm wiser and I'm older

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,100
All this time I was finding myself

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,300
And I didn't know I was lost

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,300
So wake me up when it's all over

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,500
When I'm wiser and I'm older

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,400
All this time I was finding myself

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:12,600
And I didn't know I was lost

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,100
They don't like us

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,900
Yeah i know

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:25,100
Why

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,074


21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,100
I tried carrying the weight of the world

22
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,100
But I only have two hands

23
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,000
I hope I get the chance to travel the world

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,700
And I don't have any plans

25
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,600
I wish that I could stay forever this young

26
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,400
Not afraid to close my eyes

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Life's a game made for everyone

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,100
And love is a prize

29
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,300
So wake me up when it's allover

30
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,100
When I'm wiser and I'm older

31
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,600
All this time I was finding myself

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,600
And I didn't know I was lost

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,400
So wake me up when it's all over

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,500
When I'm wiser and I'm older

35
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,700
All this time I was finding myself

36
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,200
And I didn't know I was lost

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,000
I didn't know I was lost

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,900
I didn't know I was lost

39
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,900
I didn't know I was lost

40
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,900
I didn't know I was lost

41
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,800
Get up, pack your things

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,600
Where we going

43
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Somewhere we belong
