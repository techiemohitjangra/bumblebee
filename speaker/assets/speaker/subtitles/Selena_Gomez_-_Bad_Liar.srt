00:00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:00:10,466


2
00:00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:00:13,166
i was walking down the street the other day

3
00:00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:00:15,132
trying to distract myself

4
00:00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:00:17,065
but then i see your face

5
00:00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:00:19,166
ooh wait that's someone else

6
00:00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:00:21,000
trying to play it coy

7
00:00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:00:23,000
trying to make it disappear

8
00:00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:00:25,033
but just like the battle of troy

9
00:00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:00:26,632
there's nothing subtle here

10
00:00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:00:29,000
in my room there's a king size space

11
00:00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:00:30,666
bigger than it used to be

12
00:00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:00:32,700
if you want you can rent that place

13
00:00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:00:36,765
call me an amenity

14
00:00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:00:42,600
even if it's in my dreams

15
00:00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:00:50,066
ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind

16
00:00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:00:57,766
ooooh every time i watch you serpentine

17
00:00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:01:01,533
oh i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying

18
00:00:01:01,633 --> 00:00:01:05,566
oh i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying

19
00:00:01:05,599 --> 00:00:01:08,632
not to think about you

20
00:00:01:08,665 --> 00:00:01:10,000
no no no

21
00:00:01:10,033 --> 00:00:01:12,700

22
00:00:01:12,733 --> 00:00:01:14,433

23
00:00:01:14,465 --> 00:00:01:17,500

24
00:00:01:17,599 --> 00:00:01:21,500
oh i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying

25
00:00:01:21,533 --> 00:00:01:24,632
not to give in to you

26
00:00:01:24,665 --> 00:00:01:25,599
no no no

27
00:00:01:25,632 --> 00:00:01:29,599
not to give in to you

28
00:00:01:29,632 --> 00:00:01:31,765
with my feelings on fire

29
00:00:01:32,000 --> 00:00:01:34,299
guess i'm a bad liar

30
00:00:01:34,332 --> 00:00:01:36,266
i see how your attention builds

31
00:00:01:36,299 --> 00:00:01:38,200
it's like looking in a mirror

32
00:00:01:38,233 --> 00:00:01:40,133
your touch like a happy pill

33
00:00:01:40,165 --> 00:00:01:42,265
but still all we do is fear

34
00:00:01:42,299 --> 00:00:01:44,265
what could possibly happen next

35
00:00:01:44,299 --> 00:00:01:46,265
can we focus on the love

36
00:00:01:46,299 --> 00:00:01:48,165
paint my kiss across your chest

37
00:00:01:48,200 --> 00:00:01:50,066
if you're the art i'll be the brush

38
00:00:01:50,099 --> 00:00:01:57,532
ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind

39
00:00:01:57,566 --> 00:00:02:05,200
ooooh every time i watch you serpentine

40
00:00:02:05,233 --> 00:00:02:09,000
oh i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying

41
00:00:02:09,099 --> 00:00:02:13,066
oh i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying

42
00:00:02:13,099 --> 00:00:02:16,032
not to think about you

43
00:00:02:16,066 --> 00:00:02:17,099

44
00:00:02:17,133 --> 00:00:02:20,100

50
00:00:02:33,066 --> 00:00:02:37,066
not to give in to you

51
00:00:02:37,099 --> 00:00:02:39,265
with my feelings on fire
