You've been runnin' round, runnin' round, runnin' round throwin' that dirt all on my name

3
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:18,716
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up

00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:23,817
You've been going round, going round, going round every party in LA

00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:28,104
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one

6
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:33,507
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret

7
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:37,418
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine

You don't want my heart

12
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:56,213
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new

00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:58,904
