00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:20,482 --> 00:00:23,970
Heart beats fast

3
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,130
Colors and promises

4
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:31,555
How to be brave

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,800
How can I love when I’m afraid to fall

6
00:00:39,225 --> 00:00:44,525
But watching you stand alone

7
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:52,550
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:00,300
One step closer

9
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:06,863
I have died everyday waiting for you

10
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:11,605
Darling don’t be afraid I have loved you

11
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:15,555
For a thousand years

12
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:21,777
I love you for a thousand more

13
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:30,794
Time stands still

14
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:36,132
Beauty in all she is

15
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,675
I will be brave

16
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:46,045
I will not let anything take away

17
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:51,777
What’s standing in front of me

18
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:53,937
Every breath

19
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:59,843
Every hour has come to this

20
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:07,000
One step closer

21
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:13,828
I have died everyday waiting for you

22
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:18,552

Time has brought your heart to me

27
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:43,444
I have loved you for a thousand years

28
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:55,097
I love you for a thousand more

29
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:19,783
One step closer

30
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:30,596
One step closer

I have loved you for a thousand years

38
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:13,500
I love you for a thousand more
