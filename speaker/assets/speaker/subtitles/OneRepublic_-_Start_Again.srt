7
00:00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:00:22,033

i just wanna roll my sleeves up

9
00:00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:00:27,066
and start again

10
00:00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:00:28,266
i was

11
00:00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:00:29,432
switching up the lane

12
00:00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:00:31,600
stepping out the fame i'm in

13
00:00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:00:33,232
i was

14
00:00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:00:34,399
pullin on the reigns

15
00:00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:00:36,332
sick of all the same happenins

16
00:00:00:36,365 --> 00:00:00:38,066
i swear i was

17
00:00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:00:39,399
lookin for the same disaster

18
00:00:00:39,432 --> 00:00:00:41,165
mixed with a bottle of gin

19
00:00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:00:43,066
and just because

20
00:00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:00:44,233
i come home after

21
00:00:00:44,265 --> 00:00:00:45,732
doesn't mean you take me in

22
00:00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:00:50,466
you see my world is spinning like there's nothing you know

23
00:00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:00:55,365
you see my world is feeling like it just might explode

24
00:00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:01:00,466
and yes i know it's hard to take it backwards

25
00:00:01:00,500 --> 00:00:01:02,133
for my mind

26
00:00:01:02,165 --> 00:00:01:03,500
need to get it right

27
00:00:01:03,533 --> 00:00:01:05,365
need to see some light come in

28
00:00:01:05,400 --> 00:00:01:08,166
can i just turn back the clock

29
00:00:01:08,200 --> 00:00:01:10,299
forgive my sins

30
00:00:01:10,332 --> 00:00:01:13,066
i just wanna roll my sleeves up

31
00:00:01:13,099 --> 00:00:01:15,199
and start again

32
00:00:01:15,233 --> 00:00:01:18,133
i don't think i messed it up

33
00:00:01:18,165 --> 00:00:01:20,066
time and time again

34
00:00:01:20,099 --> 00:00:01:22,532
i just wanna roll my sleeves up

35
00:00:01:22,566 --> 00:00:01:25,100
and start again

36
00:00:01:25,665 --> 00:00:01:27,700
feelin like maybe i'm unappreciated

37
00:00:01:27,733 --> 00:00:01:30,433
like my presence in your life has been alleviated

38
00:00:01:30,465 --> 00:00:01:32,665
i feel like everything i've done before is different now

39
00:00:01:32,700 --> 00:00:01:35,299
but i can see clearer than ever from a distance now

40
00:00:01:35,332 --> 00:00:01:37,165
everyday i do it i been goin' through it

41
00:00:01:37,200 --> 00:00:01:39,200
but you never knew it cuz i never showed you

42
00:00:01:39,233 --> 00:00:01:41,533
you gave me the world so i feel i owed you

43
00:00:01:41,566 --> 00:00:01:44,233
but i been lookin through the mirror, that's the old you

44
00:00:01:44,266 --> 00:00:01:46,500
imma get it right now, don't know how

45
00:00:01:46,533 --> 00:00:01:49,165
but i promise that we're gonna make it somehow

46
00:00:01:49,200 --> 00:00:01:51,365
i'm all in, it's from the heart again

47
00:00:01:51,400 --> 00:00:01:53,733
open up your mind and maybe we can start again

48
00:00:01:53,766 --> 00:00:01:56,500
can i just turn back the clock

49
00:00:01:56,533 --> 00:00:01:58,665
forgive my sins

50
00:00:01:58,700 --> 00:00:02:01,400
i just wanna roll my sleeves up

51
00:00:02:01,433 --> 00:00:02:03,500
and start again
