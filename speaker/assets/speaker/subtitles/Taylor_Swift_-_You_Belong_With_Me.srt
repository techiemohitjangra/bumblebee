1
00:00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:00:11,333
you're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset

2
00:00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:00:14,865
she's going off about something that you said

3
00:00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:00:21,566
cause she doesn't get your humor like i do

4
00:00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:00:25,865
i'm in the room, it's a typical tuesday night

5
00:00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:00:29,765
i'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like

6
00:00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:00:35,966
and she'll never know your story like i do

7
00:00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:00:40,332
but she wears short skirts, i wear t-shirts

8
00:00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:00:44,033
she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers

9
00:00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:00:47,233
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find

10
00:00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:00:50,765
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

11
00:00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:00:55,099
if you could see that i'm the one who understands you

12
00:00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:01:00,566
been here all along, so why can't you see?

13
00:00:01:00,600 --> 00:00:01:09,700
you, you belong with me, you belong with me

14
00:00:01:09,733 --> 00:00:01:14,000
walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans

15
00:00:01:14,033 --> 00:00:01:17,799
i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be

16
00:00:01:17,832 --> 00:00:01:21,500
laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself

17
00:00:01:21,533 --> 00:00:01:24,000
hey, isn't this easy?

18
00:00:01:24,033 --> 00:00:01:28,632
and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town

19
00:00:01:28,665 --> 00:00:01:32,500
i haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down

20
00:00:01:32,533 --> 00:00:01:35,966
you say you're fine, i know you better than that

21
00:00:01:36,000 --> 00:00:01:39,200
hey, what ya doing with a girl like that?

22
00:00:01:39,233 --> 00:00:01:43,200
she wears high heels, i wear sneakers

23
00:00:01:43,233 --> 00:00:01:47,033
she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers

24
00:00:01:47,066 --> 00:00:01:49,933
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find

25
00:00:01:49,965 --> 00:00:01:53,632

26
00:00:01:53,665 --> 00:00:01:57,533

29
00:00:02:08,566 --> 00:00:02:12,800

33
00:00:02:41,532 --> 00:00:02:43,332
i'm the one who makes you laugh

34
00:00:02:43,366 --> 00:00:02:45,600
