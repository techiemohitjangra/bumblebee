[Song: Hey Brother by Avicii]

00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:07,367
Hey brother

3
00:00:07,562 --> 00:00:12,437
there's an endless road to re-discover

4
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:15,945
Hey sister

5
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:20,913
know the water's sweet but blood is thicker

6
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:26,769
Oh, if the sky comes falling down,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,687
for you

8
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,941
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

9
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:38,094
Hey brother

10
00:00:38,346 --> 00:00:43,065
do you still believe in one another?

11
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:46,971
Hey sister

12
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:51,763
do you still believe in love I wonder

13
00:00:52,244 --> 00:00:57,533
if the sky comes falling down

14
00:00:57,644 --> 00:00:59,535
for you

15
00:00:59,636 --> 00:01:03,595
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

16
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:10,319
What if I'm far from home

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,301
Oh brother, I will hear you call

18
00:01:13,582 --> 00:01:16,824
What if I lose it all

19
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:19,188
Oh sister, I will help you out

20
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:24,407
Oh, if the sky comes
falling down,

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,405
for you

22
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:30,138
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,074


24
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:25,675
Hey brother,

25
00:02:25,874 --> 00:02:30,532
there's an endless road to re-discover

26
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:34,219
Hey sister,

27
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:39,280
do you still believe in love, I wonder

28
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:45,030
Oh, if the sky comes falling down

29
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,922
for you

30
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:50,983
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

31
00:02:54,444 --> 00:02:57,639
What if I'm far from home?

32
00:02:57,695 --> 00:03:00,529
Oh brother, I will hear you call

33
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:04,335
What if I lose it all

34
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:06,749
Oh sister, I will help you out

35
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,881
Oh, if the sky comes falling down,

36
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:13,851
for you

37
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:17,856
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

38
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:41,015
Tell me another story.

39
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:45,114
I think it's time for you to tell me a story

40
00:03:51,702 --> 00:03:53,443
Why do you have to go, Dad

41
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:56,256
I promise I'll be back in no time.

42
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:15,018
The End
