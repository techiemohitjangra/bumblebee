00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,000
RaMANs

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,300
We don't talk anymore

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,000
We don't talk anymore

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,100
We don't talk anymore

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,000
Like we used to do

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,000
We don't love anymore

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,800
What was all of it for

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,700
Oh, we don't talk anymore

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,800
Like we used to do

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,600
I just heard you found

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,100
You've been looking for

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,000
I wish I would have known

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,500
that wasn't me

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,900
Cause even after all this time

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,400
I still wonder

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Why I can't move on

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,300
Just the way you did so easily

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,100
Don't wanna know

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,000
What kind of dress

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,700
You're wearing tonight

21
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,400
If he's holding onto you so tight

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,800
The way I did before

23
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,900
I overdosed

24
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,500
Should've known your love was a game

25
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,900
Now I can't get you out of my brain

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,300
Oh, it's such a shame

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,700
That we don't talk anymore

28
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,000
We don't talk anymore

29
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,900
We don't talk anymore

30
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,900
Like we used to do

31
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,200
We don't love anymore

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,100
What was all of it for

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,500
Oh, we don't talk anymore

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,000
Like we used to do

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,700
I just hope

36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,100
You're lying next to somebody

37
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,400
Who knows how to love you like me

38
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,600
There must be a good reason

39
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,200
That you're gone

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,300
Every now and then I think

41
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,700
You might want me

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,000
To come show up at your door

43
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,800
But I'm just too afraid

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,300
That I'll be wrong

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,800
Don't wanna know

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,200
If you're looking into her eyes

47
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,600
If she's holding onto you so tight

48
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,300
The way I did before

49
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,500
I overdosed

50
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,800
Should've known your love was a game

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,600
Now I can't get you out of my brain

52
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, it's such a shame

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,000
That we don't talk anymore

54
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,800
We don't talk anymore

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,400
We don't talk anymore

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,700
Like we used to do

57
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,000
We don't love anymore

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,400
What was all of it for

59
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, we don't talk anymore

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,000

You're wearing tonigh

66
