I can swear I can joke I feel my mind if

2
00:00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:00:22,439
I drink if I smoke I keep up with the

3
00:00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:00:24,990
girls and you see me holding up my

4
00:00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:00:28,579
middle finger to the world

5
00:00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:00:33,030
your heavens and your pearls girls

6
00:00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:00:36,420
cuz I'm not just a pretty girl I'm more

7
00:00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:00:40,500
than just a picture I'm a daughter and a

8
00:00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:00:45,239
sister sometimes it's hard for me to

9
00:00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:00:48,899
show that I'm more than just a rumor or

10
00:00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:00:51,739
a song on your computer there's more to

11
00:00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:00:57,049
me than people know

12
00:00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:01:00,010
some days I'm wrong don't make some rich

14
00:00:01:00,009 --> 00:00:01:08,219
the Sun isn't strong Sundays I quit

15
00:00:01:08,969 --> 00:00:01:13,939
but I've been through some [ __ ] I can

16
00:00:01:11,609 --> 00:00:01:13,939
swear

I'm a hitter

21
00:00:01:38,670 --> 00:00:01:45,359
sometimes

22
00:00:01:40,950 --> 00:00:01:49,228
me to show that I'm more than just a

23
00:00:01:45,359 --> 00:00:01:55,769
title or a comment going viral there's

24
00:00:01:49,228 --> 00:00:01:58,379
more to me than people something's wrong

25
00:00:01:55,769 --> 00:00:02:01,109
don't even bridge

26
00:00:01:58,379 --> 00:00:02:09,129
some days of nice

27
00:00:02:01,109 --> 00:00:02:10,868
I quit

28
00:00:02:09,129 --> 00:00:02:15,209
don't let it show

29
00:00:02:10,868 --> 00:00:02:15,209
some [ __ ] I can swear

30
00:00:02:21,810 --> 00:00:02:24,199
