1
00:00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:00:21,699
in your eyes there's a heavy blue

2
00:00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:00:25,533
one to love and one to lose

3
00:00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:00:29,166
sweet divine, a heavy truth

4
00:00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:00:32,432
water or wine, don't make me choose

5
00:00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:00:37,600
i wanna feel the way that we did that summer night

6
00:00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:00:40,066
night

7
00:00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:00:45,733
drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

8
00:00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:00:49,099
i've been running through the jungle

9
00:00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:00:50,766
i've been running with the wolves

10
00:00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:00:54,466
to get to you, to get to you

11
00:00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:00:56,765
i've been down the darkest alleys

12
00:00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:00:58,500
saw the dark side of the moon

13
00:00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:01:02,033
to get to you, to get to you

14
00:00:01:02,299 --> 00:00:01:04,533
i've looked for love in every stranger

15
00:00:01:04,566 --> 00:00:01:06,533
took too much to ease the anger

16
00:00:01:06,566 --> 00:00:01:10,266
all for you, yea all for you

17

to get to you, to get to you

20
00:00:01:17,566 --> 00:00:01:19,200
oh to get to you

21
00:00:01:34,566 --> 00:00:01:38,200
your fingertips trace my skin

22
00:00:01:38,233 --> 00:00:01:41,733
to places i have never been

23
00:00:01:42,233 --> 00:00:01:46,066
blindly i am following

24
00:00:01:46,099 --> 00:00:01:49,165
break down these walls and come on in

25
00:00:01:49,200 --> 00:00:01:54,700
