1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,800
I threw a wish in the well

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Don't ask me I'll  never tell

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,700
I looked at you as it fell

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,100
And now you're in my way

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,900
I trade my soul for a wish

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,900
Pennies and dimes for a kiss

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,900
I wasn't looking for this

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,100
But now you're in my way

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,700
Your stare was holding

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,900
Ripped jeans

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Skin was showing

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hot night

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Wind was blowing

14
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,400

15
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,600

You took your time with the call

31

I took no time with the fall

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,900
You gave me nothing at all

33
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,000
But still you're in my way

34
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,900
I beg and borrow and steal

35
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,900
At first sight and it's real

36
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,300

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,100
