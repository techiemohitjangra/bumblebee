00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:26,106
I found a love for me

3
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:33,515
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead

4
00:00:35,000 -->  00:00:41,516
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet

5
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:49,100
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

6
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,814
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,799
Not knowing what it was

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,999
I will not give you up this time

9
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:12,655
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,206
And in your eyes you're holding mine

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,711
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,904
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song

13
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,999
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath

14
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:52,402
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

15
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:05,513
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,306
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,300
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets

18
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:27,914
To carry love, to carry children of our own

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,303
We are still kids, but we're so in love

20
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,096
Fighting against all odds

21
00:02:36,102 --> 00:02:43,801
I know we'll be alright this time

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,502
Darling, just hold my hand

23
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:51,203
Be my girl, I'll be your man

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,708
I see my future in your eyes

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:09,000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms

26
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:16,400
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song

27
00:03:16,518 --> 00:03:22,167
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful

28
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

29
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:54,515
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,999
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song

31
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,205
I have faith in what I see

32
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:11,808
Now I know I have met an angel in person

33
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:19,713
And she looks perfect, I don't deserve this

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,208
You look perfect tonight
