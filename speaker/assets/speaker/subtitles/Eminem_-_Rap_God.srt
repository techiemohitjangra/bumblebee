00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
eminem-rapgod

2
00:00:01,075 --> 00:00:04,536
look, i was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings

3
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:08,427
but i'm only going to get this one chance

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,503
something's wrong, i can feel it

5
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:17,421
just a feeling i've got, like something's about to happen, but i don't know what

6
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:20,181
if that means, what i think it means, we're in trouble

7
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:24,282
and if he is as bananas as you say, i'm not taking any chances

8
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:21,042
bigtrouble

9
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:25,683
you were just what the doctor ordered

10
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:28,972
i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god

11
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:31,972
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

12
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:35,302
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?

13
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:37,661
they said i rap like a robot, so call me rapbot

14
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:39,807
but for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes

15
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:41,588
i got a laptop in my back pocket

16
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:43,416
my pen'll go off when i half-cock it

17
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:44,833
got a fat knot from that rap profit

18
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,222
made a living and a killing off it

19
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:47,967
ever since bill clinton was still in office

20
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,946
with monica lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack

21
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:51,231
i'm an mc still as honest

22
00:00:51,237 --> 00:00:52,748
But as rude and as indecent as all hell

23
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,577
syllables, killaholic (kill 'em all with)

24
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:55,817
this slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip-hop

25
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,736
you don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap

26
00:00:57,737 --> 00:01:01,257
packing a mac in the back of the ac, backpack rap crap, yep, yep, yackity-yak

27
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,387
now at the exact same time

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,477
i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicing that

29
00:01:04,496 --> 00:01:05,866
i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table

30
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:07,646
0ver the back 0f a c0uple 0f fagg0ts and crack it in half

31
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:10,976
0nly realized it was ir0nic I was signed t0 Aftermath after the fact

32
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,032
how could i not blow? all i do is drop f-bombs, feel my wrath of attack

33
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:16,598
rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxipad

34
00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:20,996
it's actually disastrously bad for the wack
while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

35
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:24,251
i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god

36
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:27,251
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

37
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:30,576
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?

38
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:33,752
let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

39
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,012
everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like i have got

40
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,731
well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance

41
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:41,061
everybody loves to root for a nuisance

42
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,981
hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since

43
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:46,059
mc's get taken to school with this music

44
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:47,907
cause i use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme

45
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,612
now i lead a new school full of students

46
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:52,471
me? i'm a product of rakim, lakim shabazz, 2pac n-

47
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,942
-W.A, Cube, Hey D0c, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank y0u, they g0t Slim

48
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,046
inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position

49
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:02,457
to meet run dmc, induct them, into the motherfuckin' rock n'

50
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:05,797
even though i walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames

51
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,221
roll hall of fame

52
00:02:05,804 --> 00:02:08,587
0nly Hall 0f Fame I be inducted in is the alc0h0l 0f fame

53
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:13,281
you fags think it's all a game 'til i walk a flock of flames

54
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:09,677
0n the wall 0f shame

55
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:15,887
0ff a plank, and tell me what in the fuck are y0u thinking?

56
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:19,240
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face looking boy

57
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:16,902
little gay looking boy

58
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:22,955
like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy

59
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:20,321
you witnessing a massacre

60
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:25,672
0y vey, that b0y's gay, that's all they say l00king b0y

61
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:27,132
you get a thumbs up, pat on the back

62
00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:29,272
and a way to go from your label everyday looking boy

63
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,641
hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?

64
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:32,341
i get a "hell yeah" from dre looking boy

65
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:33,536
i'mma work for everything i have

66
00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:35,572
never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy

67
00:02:35,577 --> 00:02:37,135
basically boy you're never gonna be capable

68
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:38,912
to keeping up with the same pace looking boy

69
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,954
i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god

70
00:02:41,964 --> 00:02:44,949
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

71
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,301
the way i'm racing around the track, call me nascar, nascar

72
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:50,980
dale earnhardt of the trailer park, the white trash god

73
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:54,827
kneel before general zod this planet's krypton, no asgard, asgard

74
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:56,672
so you be thor and i'll be odin,

75
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,527
you rodent, i'm omnipotent

76
00:02:58,534 --> 00:02:59,926
let off then i'm reloading

77
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:01,722
immediately with these bombs i'm totin'

78
00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:03,327
and i should not be woken

79
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:06,596
i'm the walking dead, but i'm just a talking head, a zombie floating

80
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,217
but i got your mom deep throating

81
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:11,303
i'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle

82
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:14,717
i'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil

83
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:17,217
it's me, my honesty's brutal

84
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:20,393
but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though

85
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:21,517
for good at least once in a while

86
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:24,101
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle

87
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:27,297
enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times

88
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:30,267
but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned

89
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:32,872
rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime

90
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,522
i know there was a time where once i

91
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:37,702
was king of the underground, but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind

92
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,212
so i crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine

93
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,767
appeal with the skin color of mine

94
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,683
you get too big and here they come trying to

95
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,037
censor you, like that one line

96
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,542
i said on "i'm back" from the mathers lp1.
Where I

97
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:49,942
tried to say i take seven kids from columbine

98
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:53,542
put 'em all in a line, add an ak-47, a revolver and a nine

99
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:56,857
see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was.
But I've

100
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:59,406
morphed into an immortal coming through the portal

101
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,730
you're stuck in a timewarp from 2oo4 though

102
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:03,657
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for

103
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:06,498
you're pointless as rapunzel with fucking cornrows

104
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:08,331
you're like normal, fuck being normal

105
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:10,192
and i just bought a new raygun from the future

106
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:12,797
to just come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad

107
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:14,567
cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather’s pad 

108
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,305
singin' to a man while they played piano

109
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,447
man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel

110
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:21,930
so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day

111
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:23,252
''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill y0u''

112
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:25,767
lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (jj fad)

113
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,532
uh, sama lamaa, duma lamaa, you assuming, i'm a human

114
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:29,142
what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman

115
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:30,122
innovative and i'm made of rubber

116
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:32,297
so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you

117
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:33,542
i'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating

118
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:35,522
how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating

119
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:37,123
never fading, and i know that the haters are forever waiting

120
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:38,767
for the day that they can say i fell off, they'd be celebrating

121
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,997
cause i know the way to get 'em motivated

122
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:42,247
i make elevating music, you make elevator music

123
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:43,412
0h, he's t00 mainstream

124
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:45,477
well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it

125
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:48,837
it's not hip hop, it's pop, cause i found a hella way to fuse it

126
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:50,422
with rock, shock rap with doc

127
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:51,985
throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it

128
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:53,427
i don't know how to make songs like that

129
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:55,117
i don't know what words to use

130
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,262
let me know when it occurs to you

131
00:04:56,268 --> 00:04:58,062
while i’m ripping any one of these verses, that versus you

132
00:04:58,076 --> 00:04:59,690
it’s curtains, i’m inadvertently hurtin' you

133
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:01,372
how many verses i gotta murder to

134
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:05,143
prove that if you're half as nice at songs, you can sacrifice virgins to/too (ughhh)

135
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:07,022
school flunkie, pill junky

136
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:09,318
but look at the accolades the skills brung me

137
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,532
full of myself, but still hungry

138
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,320
i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to

139
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:17,817
and i'm a million leagues above you, ill when i speak in tongues

140
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:19,602
but it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you

141
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:22,937
i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel, i'm asleep in the front seat

142
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:25,997
bumping heavy d and the boys, still chunky, but funky

143
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:29,412
but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling

144
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:32,952
angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

145
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,942
they asking me to eliminate some of the women hate

146
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,022
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that i had

147
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:39,758
then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation

148
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:41,429
and understand the discrimination

149
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,697
but fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then

150
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:46,102
but if i can't batter the women

151
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:48,227
how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then?

152
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:49,425
don't mistake it for satan

153
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:51,537
it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas

154
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,702
and take a vacation to trip abroad

155
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:56,348
and make her fall on her face and don't be a retard

156
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:57,757
be a king? think not

157
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,770
why be a king when you can be a god
