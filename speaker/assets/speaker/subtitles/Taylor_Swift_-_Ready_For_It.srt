1
00:00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:00:12,761
knew he was a killer

2
00:00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:00:14,347
first time that i saw him

3
00:00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:00:17,307
wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted

4
00:00:00:17,307 --> 00:00:00:18,934
but if he's a ghost, then

5
00:00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:00:20,352
i can be a phantom

6
00:00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:00:22,939
holdin' him for ransom, some

7
00:00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:00:24,815
some boys are tryin' too hard,

8
00:00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:00:26,358
he don't try at all though

9
00:00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:00:27,777
younger than my exes,

10
00:00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:00:29,446
but he act like such a man, so

11
00:00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:00:30,864
i see nothing better,

12
00:00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:00:32,365
i keep him forever

13
00:00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:00:34,908
like a vendetta-ta

14
00:00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:00:38,621
i, i, i see how this is gon' go

15
00:00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:00:39,581
touch me

16
00:00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:00:41,124
and you'll never be alone

17
00:00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:00:42,792
i-island breeze

18
00:00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:00:44,002
and lights down low

19
00:00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:00:46,170
no one has to know

20
00:00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:00:49,048
in the middle of the night

21
00:00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:00:50,800
in my dreams

22
00:00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:00:55,095
you should see the things we do

23
00:00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:00:57,014
baby

24
00:00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:01:01,060
in the middle of the night,

25
00:00:01:01,060 --> 00:00:01:02,812
in my dreams

26
00:00:01:04,230 --> 00:00:01:06,441
i know i'm gonna be with you

27
00:00:01:06,441 --> 00:00:01:10,528
so i take my time

28
00:00:01:10,986 --> 00:00:01:12,155
are you ready for it?

29
00:00:01:17,576 --> 00:00:01:18,911
knew i was a robber

30
00:00:01:18,912 --> 00:00:01:20,330
first time that he saw me

31
00:00:01:20,329 --> 00:00:01:21,873
stealing hearts and running off

32
00:00:01:21,873 --> 00:00:01:23,416
and never sayin' sorry

33
00:00:01:23,415 --> 00:00:01:24,500
but if i'm a thief,

34
00:00:01:24,501 --> 00:00:01:26,335
then he can join the heist, and

35
00:00:01:26,335 --> 00:00:01:28,962
we'll move to an island, and

36
00:00:01:28,962 --> 00:00:01:31,006
and he can be my jailer

37
00:00:01:31,007 --> 00:00:01:32,425
burton to this taylor

38
00:00:01:32,424 --> 00:00:01:35,344
every love i've known in comparison is a failure

39
00:00:01:35,344 --> 00:00:01:36,971
i forget their names now

40
00:00:01:36,971 --> 00:00:01:38,515
i'm so very tame now

41
00:00:01:38,515 --> 00:00:01:41,099
never be the same now, now

42
00:00:01:41,099 --> 00:00:01:44,521

43
00:00:01:44,853 --> 00:00:01:45,813
touch me

44
00:00:01:45,813 --> 00:00:01:46,980
